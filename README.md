# Advent of Code

This repo contains my person solutions to [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) puzzles. All puzzles are solved in [`R`](https://cran.r-project.org/).

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024/about) is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like. People use them as interview prep, company training, university coursework, practice problems, a speed contest, or to challenge each other.

The repo is organised by year. Each year (currently only 2024 because this is the first time that I'm participating), contains two folders `R` and `data` that contain the R scripts for each day's puzzles and the input data, respectively.
